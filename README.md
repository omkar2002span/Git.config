👋 Hello World! I'm omkar wanjale, a passionate computer student eagerly exploring the realms of technology. Currently immersed in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, I'm on a journey to master the art of full-stack development.

📚 Graduate | Class of 2025

🚀 I love turning ideas into reality through code and creating seamless, user-centric applications. My current focus includes building dynamic web applications using React for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. I'm also delving into the world of databases, with a keen interest in MongoDB.

🌐 Constantly learning, growing, and embracing new challenges. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and the endless possibilities it brings to the tech community.
